# Important calls

### Monday All Hands
We kick off the week with an All Hands call, where all the teams meet and share their updates, achievements, setbacks, blockers and pretty much everything. This is a great opportunity to get a taste of how teams other than yours work. You can also expect to see the business up close.

### Morning Meetings - Allocate work/ review work 
Every weekday (except for Monday) starts off with a morning team meeting. This is where you share what you've been upto on the previous day, get tasks alotted to you and give updates on already allotted tasks. Do not shy away from sharing your suggestions and observations about anything work related!

### Mid Day Meeting - Mid Day Review


### Production EOD - to review and close work
### Product Update Calls from the Tech Team - Wednesday 

### 1:1 with Manager
1:1's are the heartbeat of your work relationship with your manager. These are setup as an hour long monthly recurring meeting on the calendar. If there is any change in the time/date, the calendar meeting will be updated to reflect it.

1:1's are **not meant for general status updates** but a time for you and your manager to talk about the following:

Your Career Growth (Goals, Opportunities)
Your Performance 
Deep Dive into absolutely Random Topics of Interest 
This is a two-sided conversation, please **come prepared** for it.
